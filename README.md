`apax`[1] is a high-performance, extendable package for training of and inference with atomistic neural networks.
It implements the Gaussian Moment Neural Network model [2, 3].
It is based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and uses [JaxMD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) as a molecular dynamics engine.


## Installation

Apax is available on PyPI with a CPU version of JAX.

```bash
pip install apax
```

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://apax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


### CUDA Support
If you want to enable GPU support (only on Linux), please overwrite the jaxlib version:

CUDA 12:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

CUDA 11:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

See the [Jax installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for more details.



## Usage

### Your first apax Model

In order to train a model, you need to run

```bash
apax train config.yaml
```

We offer some input file templates to get new users started as quickly as possible.
Simply run the following commands and add the appropriate entries in the marked fields

```bash
apax template train # use --full for a template with all input options
```

Please refer to the documentation LINK for a detailed explanation of all parameters.
The documentation can convenienty be accessed by running `apax docs`.

## Molecular Dynamics

There are two ways in which `apax` models can be used for molecular dynamics out of the box.
High performance NVT simulations using JaxMD can be started with the CLI by running

```bash
apax md config.yaml md_config.yaml
```

A template command for MD input files is provided as well.

The second way is to use the ASE calculator provided in `apax.md`.


## Input File Auto-Completion

use the following command to generate JSON schemata for training and validation files:

```bash
apax schema
```

If you are using VSCode, you can utilize them to lint and autocomplete your input files by including them in `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
    "yaml.schemas": {

        "/absolute/path/to/apaxtrain.schema.json": [
            "train.yaml"
        ]
        ,
        "/absolute/path/to/apaxmd.schema.json": [
            "md.yaml"
        ]
    }
}
```
